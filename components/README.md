# React Native Weather App

First attempt at a React Native app. No previous experience with React or mobile development.

This code is a bit more of a sandbox application pulled together from numerous experiments whilst watching and following lots of tutorials. It is not complete as I simply ran out of time. 

Code written on my MacBook using the iPhone simulator for some testing. 

There are a lot of areas I researched but there was an element of not trying to run before I could walk. However, these are some of things I was thinking about:

SOLID Principles
With C# backend development as my background, my first though on coding standards was the SOLID principles. This article in particular was useful: https://medium.com/docler-engineering/applying-solid-to-react-ca6d1ff926a4

Unit Testing
Unit tests for the React components is something I would have liked to have included based on this article: https://blog.logrocket.com/unit-testing-react-native/

Further thoughts:
Automated tests - Use Wiremock to mock API response
UI - Not relevant to this app but can ION be used as a framework for the new app?
